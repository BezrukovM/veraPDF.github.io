## Installation

The veraPDF Desktop GUI is Java application that is distributed as a single jar file that is the application installer. The installer includes the application binary files and supplementary resource files: Validation Model description, test PDF Documents and Validation Profiles.

Installation of the application is basically copying the data from the installer package to the local computer. It consists of the several steps. At the beginning of the installation it is possible to specify the installation folder:

On the next step it is possible to define which components of the veraPDF Desktop GUI are installed:

When all the selected components are installed it is possible to generate installation script that allows repeating the installation on other computers:

After installation is completed the test PDF Documents can be found in the ‘corpus’ subfolder of the application installation folder, the Validation Model description files are located in ‘model’ subfolder, and the Validation Profiles are in ‘profiles’ subfolder.

The implementation of the veraPDF Library, Desktop GUI and other relevant software components are located in ‘bin’ subfolder.
