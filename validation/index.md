veraPDF Validation Rules
---------------


The veraPDF validation engine implements the PDF/A specification using formalizations of each "shall" statement (i.e., each requirement) in PDF/A-1, PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3.

This documentation distinctly identifies each rule used by the software and provides details on the error(s) triggering a failure of the rule.

For each error the Object type, test condition, applicable specification and conformance level, as well as additional references, are provided.

Understandings based on the discussions of the PDF Validation Technical Working Group are included as appropriate.
